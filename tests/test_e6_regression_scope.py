"""E6 — regression scope: sink behavior and downstream guards.

Regression leaves are labeled ``"Pred <value>"`` instead of ``"Class <name>"``.
``_context_node`` (dpg/core.py) already treats any ``"Pred "``-prefixed label
as a terminal sink, so DPG-k mechanically builds a graph for regressors at
``context_order`` 2 and "auto" without raising. But unlike classification,
where sink count equals the known, finite number of classes, a regression
sink is only as unique as the 2-decimal-rounded leaf value: two leaves collide
into one sink purely by coincidence of rounding, not because of any modeled
notion of "output". There is therefore no "one sink per output" invariant for
regression in 0.3.0 -- these tests document the current, explicitly
out-of-scope behavior rather than assert a guarantee that does not exist.

``GraphMetrics.extract_communities`` separately assumed a classifier (it
partitions the graph into absorbing "Class " states); called on a regression
DPG it used to crash with an opaque ``numpy.linalg.LinAlgError: Singular
matrix`` because no node was absorbing. It now raises a clear ``ValueError``
instead. This is a defensive fix, not a semantic change: no classifier
behavior is touched, and no regression numeric output changes.
