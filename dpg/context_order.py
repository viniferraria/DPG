    A pooled DFG can be locally consistent while still recombining after
    several hops.  For example, observing ``A-B-C-D`` and ``X-B-C-E`` gives
    every adjacent transition a witness, but also creates the unobserved
    path ``A-B-C-E``.  This check builds a trie of observed contextual traces,
    computes each prefix state's future signature bottom-up, and verifies
    that states merged by the same contextual node have the same future
    language.  It avoids both exponential simple-path enumeration and the
    potentially large graph-by-trie product.

    The returned value is a diagnostic count, not a count of all phantom
    paths.  A value of zero is the useful acceptance condition: every graph
    path is represented by an observed trace.
